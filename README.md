# WaryrSpeak
Modify all chat in World of Warcraft to fit a role-play narrative of your character having no jaw. This addon is being loosely supported, given I no longer use it for personal use. Feel free to fork, make changes, or join Discord for modifications.

Thank you ketho-wow & ChatGPT for doing a lot of work to make this possible! :)
